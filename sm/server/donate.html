<big><big>Our Donation Policy</big></big><br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">* How is your donation used?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Your donation is applied towards Avare's continued improvement, and 
towards the internet fees we pay for providing charts and other FAA 
materials on our server. None of the Apps For Aviators volunteers 
receives any financial compensation from donations, and some of us have 
even donated both our time and money.<br>

<br>

<big><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">* Why does a Software only application need money for improvement?</span></small><br>

</big>FAA charts, databases, and plates must be pre-processed from 20 GB stitched files
 by an old desktop PC into Avare's much smaller files that can be easily
 downloaded and displayed on any Android device. In addition to our 
internet expenses your donation will help buy a faster PC so that we can
 produce better quality charts. Once donations have paid for a PC 
upgrade, we will apply future donations toward an ADS-B receiver 
purchase to enable adding free in-flight traffic and weather capability 
to avare.<br>

<br>
<big><small style="font-weight: bold;">* Are there any hidden costs to the application?</small><br>
</big>
No. The application is totally free. However, we will probably be forced
 to pass along any fees the FAA decides to start charging everyone for 
FAA charts and other materials that are currently paid for by fuel taxes
 and other FAA revenue.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">* Why does Apps For Aviators provide the application free?</span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</small>
Apps For Aviators is run by volunteers who like to fly and to write 
software code. The coding allows us to improve our programming skills, 
while making friends in the aviation and software communities. We like 
to hear your stories and ideas, and see your aircraft. By providing the 
application for free, we are joined by more volunteers, meet more 
people, learn more, and reduce everyone's cost of flying safely.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">* What happens if you do not donate?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

The application, charts and other materials will probably continue to be
 provided free because other people will continue donating their time 
and money. Many pilots have been willing to share with all of us some of
 the money Avare saves them, and some pilots have even donated much 
larger amounts to help us and the entire aviation community.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">* What happens if no one makes a donation?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

We have been very pleased by all the support and encouragement of the 
aviation and software communities. If all donations were to stop, the 
Apps4Av team would probably continue donating our own time and funds to 
keep the project going for at least a little while and then find other 
exciting things to do.<br>
